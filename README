Working On:
	- function getPlayerInput.
	- Plan is to introduce more gameStates (ie playermove, inventory, spell
	  list, menu A, menu B, etc.) and to use a switch statement to pass input
	  control to the respective "input handler". Individual keys may be
	  programmed then instead of having one consolidated function with every
	  single possible key in the game.
